Simulate different solutions to the classic hostages problem
============================================================

## The problem

> There are 100 hostages in solitary cells.
> There's a central living room with one light bulb; this bulb is initially off.
> No hostage can see the light bulb from his or her own cell.
> Everyday, the warden picks a hostage equally at random, and that hostage visits the living room.
> While there, the hostage can toggle the bulb if he or she wishes.
> Also, the hostage has the option of asserting that all 100 hostages have been to the living room by now.
> If this assertion is false, all 100 hostages are shot.
> However, if it is indeed true, all hostages are set free.
> Thus, the assertion should only be made if the hostage is 100% certain of its validity.
> The hostages are allowed to get together one night in the courtyard, to discuss a plan.
> What plan should they agree on, so that eventually, someone will make a correct assertion?
